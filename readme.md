This is my submission for Unit 3 project. 

It's the interactive registration form.
It validates the inputs and selects using RegEx.
If validation is failed the appropriate alerts or warnings are displayed
and submission is prevented.
If validation is successful the form can be submitted. 

The validation is performed both in real time and on the click of the "Register button"
